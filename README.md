Game in Open Gl implemented in C++.

The goal of the game is to destroy all the bricks in the scene.

The platform is controlled by the player by moving the mouse. With the mouse click, the ball is sent to the scene. The ball moves constantly in the direction of the platform or by reflection, when colliding with walls and bricks. If the ball reaches the bottom of the stage and is not saved by the platform, the player loses a life (and the number of objects on the screen representing the lives is diminishing).
